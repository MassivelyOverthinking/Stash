## What is Stash?

Stash is a '__slots__'-based Python class-decorator developed to assist Python developers in 
significantly reducing memory overhead when initiating individual classes. It dynamically creates a new optimised class with necessary dunder-methods behind the scene (__init__, __repr__, __eq__), and also add user-specified methods to ensure custom functionality. The application also supports immutability through 'Freeze' parameter, disabling user's ability to set attribute values post-initialisation for better memory efficiency.

## 📋 Key Features
* 🎁 Simple-to-use Python class decorator for memory optimisation.
* 🛠️ Dynamically creates __slots__-based classes to minimize memory overhead.
* ⚗️ Adds essential dunder methods (__init__, __repr__, __eq__).
* 🔄 Allows user to specify class-methods to preserve and inherit.
* ❄️ Supports attribute Freeze-functionality (_frozen) for increased memory efficiency.
* 📊 Retains original class metadata for analysis, debugging and introspection.

## 🧠 Installation

Install Stash using your preferred Package Manager.
```bash
pip install Stash
# or
poetry add Stash
# or
conda install Stash 
```

## #️⃣ Code Example

```python
from Stash import Stash

@Stash
class Example():
    name: str
    age: 
    is_single: bool

# An __init__-method is automatically generated similar to @dataclass

example1 = Example(
    name="Tony Stark",
    age=34,
    is_single=False
)

print(example1.name)        # Tony Stark
print(example1.age)         # 34
print(example1.is_single)   # False
```

## 🧊 Freeze mechanic

Stash also supports immutability by disabling modifications to instance attributes after initialization. By setting `freeze=True`, individual instances become read-only. Any attempts to modify or change attributes raises and `AttributeError`.

```python
from Stash import Stash

@Stash(freeze=True)
class Example():
    name: str
    age: int
    is_villain: bool

example1 = Example(
    name="Otto Octavius",
    age=52, 
    is_villain=True
)

example1.name = "Norman Osborn"     # Raises an AttributeError, as value are immutable.
```

## 🔒 Preserve Methods

In order to ensure Stash preserves individual and inherited class-methods utilise the `@conserve` decorator to explicitly define which methods require conservation.

```python
from Stash import Stash, conserve

@Stash
class Example():
    name: str
    age: int
    is_superhero: bool

    # Method is preserved
    @conserve
    def smash(self):
        print(f"{self.name} SMASH!")

    # Method is NOT preserved, due to lack of @conserve-decorator
    def surrender(self):     
        print(f"{self.name} surrenders!")

example1 = Example(
    name="Bruce Banner",
    age=39,
    is_superhero=True
)

example1.smash()                # Succesfully runs and prints message

try:                            # Raises AttributeError: Instance has no atribute 'surrender'
    example1.surrender()
except AttributeError as e:
    print(f"Method missing {e}")
```
